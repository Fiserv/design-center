1. <b>Default:</b>In the default state, the toggle appears in its standard appearance, ready for user interaction. It displays the current state or setting, and users can toggle it to change that state.
2. <b>Pressed:</b>The pressed state is activated when a user clicks or taps the toggle to change its state. It involves a visual change, including an orange color and a position alteration, to indicate the user's active selection.
3. <b>Loading:</b>The loading state indicates that the toggle is processing a change in state or undergoing an operation. It displays a loading animation to signify that the action is in progress.
4. <b>Disabled:</b>In the disabled state, the toggle appears non-interactive, is grayed out, and visually muted. Users cannot toggle it as it's temporarily or permanently unavailable for interaction.
5. <b>Active:</b>The active state signifies that the toggle is currently in its 'on' or active position, featuring a visual indicator with an orange color to show the chosen state.
6. <b>Inactive:</b>The inactive state represents the 'off' or inactive position of the toggle, indicating that the toggle is not currently selected.
