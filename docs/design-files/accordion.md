# Accordion

An accordion is a vertically stacked list of headers that reveals or hides associated sections of content. Accordions decrease cognitive load by allowing people to choose which sections of content they see.

Accordion is ideal for breaking down long-form or complex content into digestible chunks. It is also well-suited for mobile sites as it reduces the amount a user has to scroll.

1. <b>Collapsed Accordion panel:</b> Sections of content associated with each header. By default, panels are typically closed and revealed when a user clicks on a header or icon in the menu.
2. <b>Expanded Accordion panel:</b> Sections of content associated with each header.  These should be brief but descriptive enough to indicate what the reader can expect to learn more about by clicking.
3. <b>Label:</b> Contains section titles. These should be brief but descriptive enough to indicate what the reader can expect to learn more about by clicking.
4. <b>Chevron icon:</b> Typically appear to the left or right of the section titles, indicating that there is more content available if clicked.
