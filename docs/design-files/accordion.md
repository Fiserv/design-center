Accordion is ideal for breaking down long-form or complex content into digestible chunks. It is also well-suited for mobile sites as it reduces the amount a user has to scroll.

1. Collapsed Accordion panel: Sections of content associated with each header. By default, panels are typically closed and revealed when a user clicks on a header or icon in the menu.
2. Expanded Accordion panel: Sections of content associated with each header.  These should be brief but descriptive enough to indicate what the reader can expect to learn more about by clicking.
3. Label: Contains section titles. These should be brief but descriptive enough to indicate what the reader can expect to learn more about by clicking.
4. Chevron icon: Typically appear to the left or right of the section titles, indicating that there is more content available if clicked.
