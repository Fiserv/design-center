# Modal

A modal is a dialog that intentionally interrupts a user’s page experience. It’s often used for conveying critical information or for actions that require review or completion before returning to the task flow or page.

Modals can include critical or warning information requiring a response. However, they're also designed to support efficient task completion without losing the context of the underlying page. Users won't be able to interact with the page until the dialog is closed.

1. <b>Header:</b> Contains the modal title and optional label.
2. <b>Body:</b> Contains the information and/or controls needed to complete the modal’s task. It can include message text and components.
3. <b>Footer:</b> Contains the main actions needed to complete or cancel the dialog task. Button groupings change based on the modal variant.
4. <b>Close icon:</b> The close icon will close the dialog without submitting any data.
5. <b>Overlay:</b> Screen overlay that obscures the on-page content.
