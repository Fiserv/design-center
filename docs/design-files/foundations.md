| FOUNDATION | DESCRIPTION |
| -------- | -------- |
| [Color](?path=docs/design-files/color.md)   | Color is a fundamental element in the visual language of the Pointe Design System by Fiserv, playing a crucial role in creating consistent experiences across various contexts within Fiserv.   |
| [Elevation](?path=docs/design-files/elevation.md)   | Elevation utilizes shadows and blurs to create a layered effect, offering users a visual cue that an object or experience is 'elevated' in priority or hierarchy.   |
| [Logo](?path=docs/design-files/logo.md)   | The Fiserv logo represents an enhanced market approach and a transformation in financial-services technology.   |
| [Spacing](?path=docs/design-files/spacing.md)  | The Pointe Design System utilizes an 8-point grid system for sizing, spacing, and laying out components relative to one another. This ensures that padding, margin, button height, etc., are always multiples of 8 pixels for consistency.   |
| [Typography](?path=docs/design-files/typography.md)   | Typography is a deliberate system of letters, numbers, and characters. Good typography ensures legibility, clean aesthetics, and a well-defined information hierarchy.   |
